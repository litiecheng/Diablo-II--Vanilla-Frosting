I'm redistributing these No CD exes for the benefit of others. All credit goes to GalaXyHaXz.

Diablo II
---------
These are clean Game.exe's from pre-1.12, which have been
decrypted and all securom wiped. They are virus free and
essentially the same file Blizzard themselves had before
securoming them. Feel free to use in your mod or if you
are just playing pre-1.12.

*NOTE 1: Since these Game.exe's are securom
free, you can easily disassemble the code as well as
load them into a debugger.

*NOTE 2: The Game.exe for 1.01 is the exact same as the
Game.exe for 1.00. This is why it is not included.

*NOTE 3: I only take partial credit for these.
