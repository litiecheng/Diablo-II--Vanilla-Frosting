The following code enables 6 affixes on Weapons/Armors/Rings/Amulets
and 4 affixes on Jewels. The above items will sometimes spawn with more
or less affixes though since the game modifies the base offset chance
that I've set. So you might get rare gear with 5 or 7 affixes, or jewels with
3, 5, or 6 affixes, etc.

This function is responsible for the affix.

Some more clues are when you see these lines (not in sequential order):

MOV ECX,6AC690C5 
CMP EAX,3A
AND EAX,7

Basically once you find the CMP EAX,3A, the next lines will have a check of JNE and it will jump close
to the address responsible for the weapon/armor/rings/amulet line.

Once you MOV r32, 6 and then JMP .. you JMP to the address the second statement that takes EDX and assigns it
to the appropriate location (There will be a CMP/TEST after it).

Jewel code (located closely above the weapon/armor etc code) actually jumps to the line right after the next
line after the address related to the JMP we made in our change for the weapons/armor/etc (After the jewel code runs).
