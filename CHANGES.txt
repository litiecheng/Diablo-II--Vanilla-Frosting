Vanilla Frosting 9.0.0 [1.14d]
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on Saturday, June 10, 2017
----------------------------------------

9.0.0
------------
- Updated the Mod to 1.14d, and with that comes Blizzard's improved compatibility fixes.
- Glide Wrapper is now bundled with the Mod. Check the Extras directory.
- CPU fix no longer needs to be applied since Blizzard fixed this in the 1.14b update.

8.3.0
------------
- The infinite loop bug that caused the game to use a lot of CPU resources (25%-50%+)
  is now fixed in game (still happens in menu and character creation screen).
- Smith and Griswold Nightmare loot table is now fixed.
- Lysander in Act 2 now sells TP/ID Books & Scrolls.
- All new characters start out with a horadric cube.
- Increased the size of the stash and cube in order to encourage players to:
  1. Balance the pros/cons of keeping an item
  2. Keep the players actively engaged in their current games
  3. Reduce frequency of having to leave the game to mule
  4. Make VF independent from external applications (ATMA/GoMule)
 
* Notes *
  - This means VF is no longer compatible with external muling applications like ATMA or GoMule.
    
  - TLDR; Don't use GoMule with Classic characters or you will lose all your items.
  
    GoMule (by design) doesn't support Classic characters and if you open a Classic
    character in GoMule and save, you will get a "dead bodies" error when
    loading that character. The solution to recover your character is to take all of that character's
    items off that character permanently. You will _not_ be able to get those items back.
    This is not a VF issue, GoMule just _doesn't support_ Classic.

8.2.0
------------
- Reverted the chest/monster item drops to be the same as vanilla,
  with the exception that any difficulty that can drop a rune, will still
  drop any run up to what The Countess can drop in that difficulty.
  
8.1.0
------------
- 1.09 support has been completely removed and the mod is rebased back to 1.13d.
- Some loot tables in Normal Act 1 will now only drop Jewelry and Chipped Gems.
- Item Ratios are back to what they were in original 1.10 (rather than bringing them back to 1.09).
- Smith and Griswold loot tables are back to what they were (with wrong loot table - hell drops in NM) for Nightmare difficulty.
- Lysander no longer sells TP/ID Books & Scrolls (since he didn't in the original game).
- Including the original files that this mod changes in case you want to easily uninstall the mod.
  
8.0.0
------------
- Rebased the mod from 1.13d version of Diablo II back to 1.10f. 1.10 was the last 
  version of Diablo II developed by Blizzard North. This brings the game back
  to before keys, essences, and respecs were introduced.
  
- For the 1.10f, a few things are no longer included from the 1.13d stuff that VF 7.0.2 had:
  > Item Ratios are back to what they were in original 1.10 (rather than bringing them back to 1.09).
  > Smith and Griswold loot tables are back to what they were (with wrong loot table - hell drops in NM) for Nightmare difficulty.
  > Lysander no longer sells TP/ID Books & Scrolls (since he didn't in the original game).
  
7.0.2
------------
- Switched 1.09 back to 1.09d and just fixed the Chance to Cast bug only.

7.0.1
------------
- Switched 1.09 base from 1.09d to 1.09b so that we have working CtC.

7.0.0
------------
- Vanilla Frosting now supports 1.09d.

Since VF primarily re-implemented 1.09 features in 1.10+,
it makes logical sense to just use 1.09d and include only the
specific components that are necessary to enhance the 1.09 experience.

> Hardcore characters can be made even without beating Softcore.
> The 'players' command is no longer needed as well and the statistics are
  the same as the VF 1.13d stuff (exp and item drops are the same as an 8 player group,
  but HP is the same as a 1 player game).
> Multiple 1.09d clients are allowed.
> You can now open the Cow Level with just a town portal book.
> You can now open the Cow Level even if you kill the King.

6.1.0
------------
- Resistances and Immunities are back to Normal (Stock). Cows resistances have been kept as 0 (1.09).
- The /players command is basically useless now. At /players 1, the users will now have the /players 8
  benefits, without the consequences:

  - Monster experience is the same as /players 8
  - Monster hit points are the same as /players 1
  - Monster item drops and chest item drops are the same as /players 8.

  At the moment, the only thing /players 8 is used for is if you want to increase the monster's
  damage and attack rating. This might be removed in the future.
- Slightly adjusted monster, bosses, chests - jewelry, gems, runes drop rates in Act 1 Normal.
- Drop rates are back to stock for all monsters except for the improvements done to jewelry, gems, and runes.
- Fixed Griswold's Nightmare loot table. Had same problem as Smith (Probably copied pasted by Blizzard).
  
6.0.1
------------
- The rune extraction/preserve recipes have been removed since they allow a person to
  pretty much re-roll with no penalty.
 (Plus rune drop rates, methods of finding them have been improved for a while so it won't take
  forever to actually find the runes - and don't forget that there are rune upgrade/downgrade recipes).
- The chest drops rates have been redone.

6.0.0
------------
- The size of the stash, cube, and inventory have been restored to normal. Use GoMule.
- Characters no longer start out with a Horadric Cube
- Monster HP is no longer the same between /players 8 and /players 1. It is back to normal.
  The game became way easier once the characters acquired top end gear.
  
* For players migrating over from 5.9.0, the inventory size is back to normal, so before you
  upgrade, you need to move the items out of the extra space sections of the character before
  you switch them over. Just make sure the items are in an appropriate position.
  
5.9.0 Changes
------------
- Reverted most monsters to drop their normal treasure classes.
  > Only bosses and some unique monsters now drop the highest treasure
    classes for their act.
  > The overall drop rate and improve chests are still in effect.
- The item ratio has been changed to that of 1.09.
- Integrated "Pack Rat" Inventory/Stash/Cube mod into Vanilla Frosting.

5.8.0 Changes
------------
- Removed the ethereal cube recipes
- Fixed a bug where a character can reach level 100 (99 is the norm)
- Drop rates have been increased
- Chests have been massively improved. They now drop better equipment for the act
  they are on, they can drop any gem, and the same jewelry on any act/difficulty,
  and they can drop the same runes as Countess can drop on that difficulty.
- All monsters (including bosses) now have the probability of dropping the best equipment
  that they can on their specific act and difficulty. This means they can drop stuff from
  a higher treasure class.

5.7.0 Changes
------------
- 4 New Cube Recipes (Weapon and Armor are each a recipe):
    Non-ethereal destructible armor or weapon + Stamina Potion + Town Portal Scroll = Makes the item Ethereal
    Any weapon or Armor + Hel Rune + Antidote + Town Portal Scroll = Unsockets Item and keeps both gems/runes and the item (Preserve)
    
5.6.2 Changes
------------
- The inventory space has now been increased.
- All new characters start out with a horadric cube.

5.6.1 Changes
------------
- Essences have been removed. You will now only have the 3 respecs provided by Akara.

5.6.0 Changes
------------
- Increased the size of the stash and cube again in order to encourage
  players to:
  1. Balance the pros/cons of keeping an item
  2. Keep the players actively engaged in their current games
  3. Reduce frequency of having to leave the game to mule
  4. Make VF independent from external applications (ATMA/GoMule)
 
  * Note, this means VF is no longer compatible with external muling
    applications like ATMA or GoMule.
  
5.5.2 Changes
------------
- Fixed a bug where rune downgrades for below 8 weren't working.
- Monster experience has been restored to normal (1x)
 
5.5.1 Changes
------------
- Major improvements to rune drop rates
    Runes 19+ have about 1% chance to drop
    Runes below 19 have been equalized depending on their previous values.
- Monsters will once again have a chance to not drop something

5.5.0 Changes
------------
- Improved rune drop rates
- Monster resistances/immunities have been completed removed
- Monsters will no longer have a chance to not drop anything
- Monster experience has been doubled
- Monster HP on /players 8 now equals their HP on /players 1.

* This means that this mod is meant to be played on /players 8.
So you get the benefits of having the maximum amount of items to drop
but without having the monster's HP increase.

5.4.1 Changes
------------
- Hyperjoin has been removed since I've noticed a massive desync issue in
  1.09's Hyperjoin. This issue could possibly also happen in 1.13.

5.4.0 Changes
------------
- Shield block is back to the default way in the Expansion
- The barbarian's whirlwind is back to the default way in the Expansion
- All monster immunities are back to their standard values.
- All act bosses and ancients have the same levels and resistances as before (vanilla).

5.3.0 Changes
------------
- Fixed some remnant monster that had a resistance value over 100.
- You are now able to join TCP/IP games _a lot_ faster
- Shield block works in expansion as it does in classic
- The barbarian's whirlwind skill now works in expansion as it does in classic

5.2.0 Changes
------------
- Monster levels and resistances have been restored to 1.13d defaults, and then all resistances
  have been reduced to a maximum of 100 (Thus immunities that drop below 100 are broken).
- The levels and resistances for the following bosses and monsters have been changed to those similar in 1.09:
    - Andariel
    - Duriel
    - Mephisto
    - Diablo

    - Ancients
    - Cows

4.0 Changes:
-------------
- Returned the Experience table to the regular 1.13 ones (The Level is still 100, and you still receive 100% of experience).
- Rune drop rates have been further balanced

3.9F Changes:

- Paladin auras have been removed from left hand because they wouldn't activate.

3.8F Changes:
--------------
In this patch I relooked at the mod completely and decided to bring it even more back to the normal Diablo experience.

- Skill delays are back to normal.
- Immunities are back in the game but are maxed at 100% so that they can be broken.
- Redid the Experience Table again and increased the experience cap from 1,000,000,000 to 2,000,000,000. This affects all the values going down.
- Monster experience throughout the entire game has increased to compensate for the new experience table.
- In memory of Diablo 1, the maximum number of players in a game can only be 4. So make sure to pick your members wisely. In Single Player, you can still use the /players command up to 8.
- The number of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm are back to normal.
- Throwing weapons stack size have been increased by 5x.

3.71F Changes:
--------------
- Included my the new version of my Experience Generator
- Regerated the Experience Table with the Experience Generator so it's closer to my original vision.

3.7F Changes:
-------------
- Drop table has been heavily improved. You will now find a wider range of items. Before, the drops would be stuck around a specific point (consequetive Artic Furs dropping)
- Gold will no longer drop. Most people probably pick up items and sell them rather than pick up 1 or 2 pieces of gold.
- Runes are slightly harder to find
- You can now redo the Cow Level even if you kill the king.
- The recipe to make the Cow Level is now just a Tome of Town Portal.
- Brand new Experience table
- All skill delays have been removed.
- You can now use Teleport, Thunder Storm, Battle Orders, Battle Command, and Shout in town.

3.6F Changes:
-------------
- Completely new experience table. The maximum level is now 100.
* I tried to keep the experience linear, than exponential. The maximum experience is 1,000,000,000 = Lvl 100.
* There is an Experience Table spreadsheet included in the archive for any future modders.

3.5F Changes:
-------------
- Brand new drop system again, a lot of things were equalized, and so you have a much better chance of finding top level items and runes. Chests, Bosses, Mini-Bosses, Dead bodies also have improved with the new system.
- Difficulty penalties have been restored. So don't die, and boost up your resistances!

3.0F Changes:
-------------
- Fixed a Blizzard typo that gave Smith and Griswold in Nightmare, Hell unique drops instead of Nightmare ones.

- Scrapped the previous drop rates and made a completely new one with a different algorithm in handling calculations (not a hardcoded algorithm, but a self-algorithm). The new drop rates are based on the Blizzard drop rates, and are better than the vanilla ones.

- Everything in the game will ALWAYS drop something. 

- Added the ladder runewords to Single Player again. I forgot to include the required file in the previous releases.

- Added the rune downgrade system back into the game.

- (Spreadsheet) Added polished versions of my DropRate.ods and RuneDropRate.ods spreadsheets to the zip for your convenience and viewing. This also helps future mod makers with their own mods, or if they want to build upon my mod.

- (Spreadsheet) Added MonStats_Level.ods spreadsheet to the zip for your convenience and viewing. This also helps future mod makers with their own mods, or if they want to build upon my mod.

2.5F Changes:
-------------
- Fixed the super unique immunity bug. Some super uniques still had immunities when spawning with FE/CE/LE/MR/Physical Resistance (Stoneskin). These modifiers have now been disabled from the game.

- Continued to improve and balance drop rates through out the entire game

- You can now find Essenses in all difficulties (For Respec/Token of Absolution - Andy, Meph, Diablo, Baal)

2.01F Changes:
--------------
- All skills can now be used either on left or right hand.

2.00F Changes:
--------------
- All cube recipes are now completely unlocked (including tempered recipes).

- Rune downgrade recipes have been removed.

- All uniques are now enabled and available on non-ladder (Doesn't really affect Single Player/TCP-IP since you already have them)

- Difficulty penalties are now removed (Resistance, Exp, Life/Mana, Static Field)

- Drop rates for the entire game have been re-done and improved. 
This doesn't mean you are going to find better item quality types (unique,set,rare,magic). It just means you have a better chance to a better item than junk.
The new drop rates also encourage players to kill regular monsters, and open chests more often to find items. A player shouldn't be forced to MF in order to find items. The items will also help you along your adventure.

- Resistances for each difficulty has been set back to their respective values, but the maximum resistance in the game is now 75%. This puts the monsters and the characters at an even playing field.
Also note, that your pets also have a maximum of 75% unless you increase it somehow. Fire Golem normally has 100% resistance, now it only has 75%, etc.

Changes/Enhancements to Vanilla Diablo II 1.13C - 1.00F:
------------------------------------------------
- Experience Ratio has been fixed to not diminish starting from level 70.
Meaning you will always get 100% off the monster experience.

- Ladder Runewords are now enabled and can be used on Single Player & TCP/IP

- Immunities in all difficulties are now the same as Normal.
This permits people to actually be able to solo Hell without HAVING to make horrible dual builds. This also lets you experiment with other build styles as well.

- You can now cube all 33 runes by placing 2x runes -> next rune.

- All recipes are now unlocked for non-ladder players as well. (Doesn't really affect anyone since this is for SP & TCP/IP.

- All map sizes (outside, and dungeons) are back to pre-1.10 style which means that they are the same size as normal. Small and comfortable.

- Changed cows level back to 90 (1.09) from 81. Now you will be able to find higher iLvl drops.
The 1.10+ cows already gave you more experience than 1.09 cows, so me increasing the level requirement, will actually give you 9785 more experience per kill. 
The only reason I can see from the slowing down of hell cows for leveling in 1.10+ is that the exp ratio was nerfed.

- You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens (like pre 1.10)

- You can now run multiple clients of Diablo II for Single Player - TCP/IP purposes ONLY

- Rune drop rate chances have been increased by 10x. Even though Blizzard increased the chances, they were still a joke.
Default drop rates and New drop rate spreadsheet/charts are included in the zip.
Don't be fooled, 10x isn't much compared to the actual percentages..

(Before) Zod: .0193%
(After) Zod: .1931%

- The amount of Cows in the Moo Moo Farm has been increased by 2x.

- Bosses, Mini-Bosses, and Cows drop rates have been increased by 3x.

- Countess can now drop up to a Zod
Note, Countess's drop rate has a 50/50 chance of either dropping an item and or a rune. If she decides to drop a rune, the normal rune calculations apply.
