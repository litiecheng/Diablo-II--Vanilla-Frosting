Vanilla Frosting 12.1.0 [1.14d]
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on Wednesday, October 4, 2017
----------------------------------------

Vanilla Frosting is a Diablo II mod that was designed to keep
the feeling of Diablo II as vanilla as possible, while enhancing
and tailoring it to the Single Player experience.

**** New Features ****
- The 'players' command is no longer used. In exchange, you will
  automatically have the following benefits enabled:

  > Monster hit points is the same as /players 1.
  > Monster experience is the same as /players 8.
  > Monster damage and attack rating is the same as /players 1.
  > Monster and chest item drops are the same as /players 8.

  Just open Diablo II, start a game, and enjoy :).

  * This is similar in spirit to how Diablo 1's Single Player was easier than Diablo 1's
    Multi Player due to Multi Player monsters having double the HP of their Single Player
    counterparts, and having monsters experience capped to 200 exp per player level.

- The size of the stash and cube have been increased.
- All new characters start out with the Horadric Cube.
- You can now open the Cow Level with just a town portal book.
- You can now open the Cow Level even if you kill the King.
- Ladder Runewords are now enabled on Single Player.
- You now have unlimited respecs through Akara on all difficulties. Essences & Keys do not drop.
- [Recipe] Upgrade a rune by placing: 2x Rune -> Next Rune (up to Zod)
- [Recipe] Downgrade a rune by placing: Rune + Antidote -> Previous Rune.
- Improved Rune Drop Rates.
  > Before: Fal through Zod would scale down from 0.0082% to 0.0001%.
  > After : All runes Fal and above have a stable 0.01%.
