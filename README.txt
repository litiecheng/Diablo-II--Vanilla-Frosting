Vanilla Frosting 9.3.0 [1.14d]
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on Tuesday, September 26, 2017
----------------------------------------

Vanilla Frosting is a Diablo II mod that was designed to try to keep
Diablo II as vanilla as possible, while enhancing and tailoring it to
the Single Player experience.

**** Changes ****

- The 'players' command is no longer used. In exchange, you will
  automatically have the following benefits enabled:

  > Monster hit points is the same as /players 1
  > Monster experience is the same as /players 8
  > Monster damage and attack rating should be the same as /players 1 (Needs confirmation).
  > Monster item drops and chest item drops are the same as /players 8.

  Just open Diablo II, start a game, and enjoy :).

  * This is similar in spirit to how Diablo 1's Single Player was easier than Diablo 1's
    Multi Player due to Multi Player monsters having double the HP of their Single Player
    counterparts, and having monsters experience capped to 200 exp per player level.

- You can now open the Cow Level with just a town portal book.
- You can now open the Cow Level even if you kill the King.
- You can now run multiple instances of Diablo II.
- All new characters start out with the Horadric Cube.
- The size of the stash and cube have been increased.
- Ladder Runewords are now enabled on Single Player.
- Rune drop rates have been improved.

**** Back from 1.09 ****

- The experience penalty after level 70 has been removed.
- You will now once again receive experience beyond 2 screens.
- Maps have the same size on all difficulties.
