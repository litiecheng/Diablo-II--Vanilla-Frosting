Vanilla Frosting 10.0.0 [1.14d]
By Jonathan Vasquez (fearedbliss)
Released on Thursday, September 28, 2017
----------------------------------------

Vanilla Frosting is a Diablo II mod that was designed to keep
the feeling of Diablo II as vanilla as possible, while enhancing
and tailoring it to the Single Player experience.

**** Changes ****

- The 'players' command is no longer used. In exchange, you will
  automatically have the following benefits enabled:

  > Monster hit points is the same as /players 1.
  > Monster experience is the same as /players 8.
  > Monster damage and attack rating is the same as /players 1 on all difficulties.
  > Monster item drops and chest item drops are the same as /players 8.

  Just open Diablo II, start a game, and enjoy :).

  * This is similar in spirit to how Diablo 1's Single Player was easier than Diablo 1's
    Multi Player due to Multi Player monsters having double the HP of their Single Player
    counterparts, and having monsters experience capped to 200 exp per player level.
